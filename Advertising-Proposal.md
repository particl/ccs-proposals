Particl badly needs advertising.  We are an amazing project with a working DAPP (the marketplace), yet no one knows about us, and our liquidity is nonexistant.

This makes it difficult for the devs to sell the funds they receive from the treasury.  If we go on like this much longer, we may just die out.

The marketplace is finished, and it is the perfect time to advertise it (along with the fact we are planning a DEX to go with the marketplace).

There is about 46,000 part in the treasury, that is up to the community how to spend.

In addition, there is 138,000 part in the reserve fund that is not needed at the moment.  It is leftover from the first dev funding proposal,
and they currently have the second funding proposal keeping them going.

It is up to the devs what the 138,000 part will be used for.

I am asking simultaneously for the community to approve the 46,000 part in the treasury to be used for advertising, and for the devs to approve
the 138,000 (or a chunk of them) to be also approved for advertising.

I've researched many advertising options, and the ones that seem best to me are:

1) Appearing in coinmarketcap's trending section.  This costs $1 CPC (per click)
2) Appearing in coinmarketcap's newsletter.  This is expensive:  $6k for a day, $20k for a week, $50k for a month.
3) Having a sponsored video by youtuber DataDash (500k subscribers and consistently 50k views/video).  This costs $4-15k depending on the length of the
   sponsored section for us
4) Having a dedicated channel in Max Maher's discord.  This costs $2500
5) Using chainwire.org, which guarentees a news release that we write gets featured in tons of online crypto publications.  This costs $1.5-9k depending
   on how many places we want to be featured.
6) Using the PR firm Market Across, which has led PR campaigns for projects such as: Binance, Polkadot, Huobi, TRON, Polygon(Matic), Tezos, Crypto.com, eToro,
   Consensys, Bybit, Cardano, NEO, and Qtum.  The price of this varies greatly from a one time payment of $100, to a monthly recurring payment of $20k
   
   
Many of these companies sent me case studies and pdfs of more information, but I wanted to keep this CCS proposal short and sweet.  If anyone is interested in
a certain option listed here, I can post in the comment section what the company has sent me, so you can read more in depth.
