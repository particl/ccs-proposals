This is the proposal to get a dev or a team of devs to create a smart contract on the polygon chain that would "Wrap" the part token to the ethereum ecosystem.
This would give the PARTicl chain unprecedented access to the whole of the crypto ecosystem. 

The contract would be a wbtc style contract with their whitepaper being here: https://wbtc.network/assets/wrapped-tokens-whitepaper.pdf
Users would deposit their part into the contract address and their ERC-20 PART would appear on the polygon network that is on the ETH blockchain, where it can be used. And can swapped back.
The devs doing this would be devs who have the experience to do this and have forked projects like this before successfully.
The contract would be audited by the PARTicl team and perhaps have a external audit before launching.
The amount required to pay the devs and get this done, would be from 500$ to 2,000$ depending on which team we go with and if we decide to go with a external audit.
Thanks!
