# Summary

This proposal is a funding request by the Particl team. It requests **35,250 PART per month** from the treasury fund for **12 months**, after which the team will submit a new funding request for a community vote.

### Note

This proposal is a brief, summarized version of our comprehensive proposal available [here](https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-3/). If you haven't yet done it, please take the time to read the full proposal, which contains all of the details surrounding this funding request, as well as our [newly-announced strategic path forward](https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/) which we'll be following throughout this funding cycle.

# Use of Funds

The Particl team operates strictly on community donations under the approval of Particl stakeholders. Funding, in PART, is taken directly from the network’s treasury and allocated to the team to fund its operations. 

With the current PART price in mind, **the Particl team is requesting 35,250 PART coins per month, for 12 months**, from the treasury to uninterruptedly fund the upcoming development cycle at the current pace and pay for the various operation-related expenses, including legal, administration, corporate fees, and similar spendings. 

With better PART prices and liquidity, the extra PART will be used to grow the team and fund various marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to promote the ecosystem and its dApps.

# Legal Entity

All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd ([SoonTM.io](https://soontm.io), an independent software development company.
